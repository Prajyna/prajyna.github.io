\textbf{Paper} & \textbf{Abstract:} The paper estimates time-varying matching efficiency and match elasticity within a Cobb-Douglas matching function for the U.S. non-farm sector, using a state-space model. It evaluates two specifications: (i) no constant returns to scale (CRS) with time variation (my baseline model) and (ii) CRS with time variation. I compare these two models with the standard model without time variability, and results show significant time variation in both parameters, even under stochastic volatility. Counterfactual vacancy estimates reveal that the non-CRS baseline model fits the data best. This model suggests a gradual decline in matching efficiency, indicating growing labor market inefficiencies. Matching efficiency and match elasticity with respect to unemployment are found to be procyclical. The procyclicality in efficiency can be attributed to reduced sectoral reallocation, as seen in IPUMS-CPS data, driven by structural economic shifts. Procyclical match elasticity points to the nonlinear effect of labor market tightness on the job-finding rate. The paper also finds a rise in the efficient unemployment rate after COVID-19, as estimated by the baseline model.\\
