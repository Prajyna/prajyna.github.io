**Hello and welcome to my website!**

::: justify
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research focuses on understanding the evolving trade-offs between job vacancies and unemployment in the U.S. labor market. My overall research focuses on on understanding the Beveridge curve dynamics and therefore understanding the dynamics of unemployment. I find that matching efficiency in the labor market has declined over time since 2003. The decline partly explains the decline in job finding rates during recessions and thus explains an increase in unemployment rate. However, I also find that the effects of inflows to unemployment have increased post Great Recession compared to the outflows suggesting that the huge increase in inflows was the primary reason for the shift in the Beveridge Curve during COVID and not the decline in matching efficiency.

My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of the U.S. labor market incorporating labor market flows using individual level data, how has it changed overtime. I examine the sources of labor market inefficiencies and I also work on understanding the implications changing labor market on output gap and inflation. My primary focus is in empirical macroeconomics and time series analysis (both bayesian and frequentist).

In my job market paper link [here](Job_market_paper_Prajyna.pdf), I contribute to the literature by estimating time-varying matching efficiency within a state-space modeling framework to explain shifts in the Beveridge curve. I find that matching efficiency is pro-cyclical and that its decline during downturns—evident through micro-level data—contributes to a rising unemployment gap and a falling job-finding probability during recessions.
