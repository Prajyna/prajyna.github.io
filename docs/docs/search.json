    "text": "Hello and welcome to my website!\n\nI am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research focuses on understanding the evolving trade-offs between job vacancies and unemployment in the U.S. labor market. My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of unemployment, in particular how those fluctuations shape the understanding of the Beveridge curve dynamics. I examine the sources of labor market inefficiencies and I also work on understanding the implications changing labor market on output gap and inflation. My primary focus is in empirical macroeconomics and time series analysis.\nIn my job market paper link here, I contribute to the literature by estimating time-varying matching efficiency within a state-space modeling framework to explain shifts in the Beveridge curve. I find that matching efficiency is pro-cyclical and that its decline during downturns—evident through micro-level data—contributes to a rising unemployment gap and a falling job-finding probability during recessions.\nYou can find my teaching philosophy and research statement here.\nContact Information\nIf you’d like to learn more about my background, please feel free to view my CV here."

    "text": "My research lies at the intersection of macroeconomics and labor economics, with specific focus on understanding the dynamics of the U.S. labor market. In particular, my research focuses on examining the factors affecting the shifts in the U.S. Beveridge Curve both at aggregate and industry level and contribute to the growing literature of labor market frictions and labor market flows. My primary research area is empirical macroeconomics and time series analysis, with secondary focus on Bayesian econometrics and econometrics. In general, my research approach is guided by asking seemingly simple but fundamental questions that explain movement in the most important macroeconomic variables—because even the simplest questions often demand deep analytical thinking and sophisticated empirical methods.\nMy dissertation consists of three chapters. My first chapter is my job market paper, titled ‘Estimating time-variation in matching efficiency and match elasticity for the US labor market’ where I study how labor market frictions evolved over time for the U.S. non-farm sector. In the paper, I estimate the time varying matching efficiency using a state space model. I find evidence for significant time variation in matching efficiency which experienced a gradual decline, indicating growing labor market inefficiencies. Matching efficiency reflects the productivity of the process through which jobs are matched to job seekers. I find matching efficiency to be pro-cyclical, which can be attributed to increased reallocation of workers between industries and higher composition of non-degree workers in the unemployed pool during the Great Recession. The paper contributes to the literature by finding evidence of explaining matching efficiency using CPS data. For COVID-19, factors such as reallocation and composition are not significant. The paper also estimates unemployment gap using models with and without time variation and find counter intuitive gaps when time variation is not accounted for. Therefore, the paper provides new insights on the shifting of the Beveridge Curve and highlights the importance of incorporating the micro-level data into macro-labor models.\nMy second chapter is titled ’Understanding the unemployment dynamics’, where I revisit unemployment dynamics over the period 2003–2024, both in aggregate and across industries, using micro-level CPS data from IPUMS. I find that transitions from non-participation to both employment and unemployment play an important role. During the Great Recession, the increase in unemployment reflected both stronger inflows into unemployment (from employment and the labor force) and weaker outflows into employment. In contrast, during COVID-19, the sharp increase in unemployment was driven almost entirely by higher inflows from employment into unemployment. The relative importance of different flows for the cyclicality of unemployment also shifted over time, reflected both at aggregate and industry level. Between 2006 and 2012, job separations and job-finding rates had effects of comparable magnitude. However, in the subsequent period countercyclical separations became the dominant driver of cyclical fluctuations in unemployment, while the role of job finding diminished. Finally, the variation in the transitions from nonparticipation to unemployment accounted for 15–20% of the cyclical variation in the unemployment rate between 2013 and 2024. Combining the conclusion of chapter 1 and 2, I find that the shift in the Beveridge Curve during the Great Recession was driven by both inflows and outflows (affected by decline in matching efficiency) while the shift in the Beveridge Curve was mainly due to increase in job separations and therefore the Beveridge Curve shifted back. The paper also finds lots of heterogeneity across industries and suggests that the relative importance of inflows has changed over time, especially after COVID.\nThird chapter is titled ‘Estimated ouput gap in a wage-inflation expectations model’ is joint work with Azharul Islam, Irina Panovska and Srikanth Ramamurthy. We study how incorporating adaptive learning-based inflation expectations for price and wage inflation can improve the performance of Unobserved Components (UC) models for estimating the output gap. We estimate output gap under bivariate adaptive learning process which allows feedback between wage and price inflation under New Keynesian Phillips Curve framework, augmenting a conventional reduced-form UC model for output and unemployment with this bivariate learning process. Three interesting sets of results stand out. First, our model captures turning points and the business cycle amplitude accurately, especially when compared to models with univariate learning that do not incorporate labor market data. Second, while the perceived persistence of inflation fell during the early stages of the pandemic, it increased sharply and substantially 2021-2023. While it declined after 2024, it remains at an elevated level when compared to the pre-COVID period. Finally, we find that the cross-effects of wage and price inflation vary substantially over time. Central to this dissertation is understanding factors affecting unemployment rate and how inclusion of unemployment rate improves the estimation of output gap.\n\n\nIn another project that builds on my work on Beveridge curves, I collaborated with Luis Fernando Colunga-Ramos, Irina Panovska, Miroslava Quiroga-Trevino and B. Elam Rodríguez-Alcaraz, titled ’Mexico’s Labor Market through the Lens of the Beveridge Curve’ . This paper is a Bank of Mexico working paper. In this project we present the first Beveridge Curves for Mexico and its regions, constructed from a newly compiled dataset on job vacancies. Building on the vacancy–unemployment relationship that defines the Beveridge Curve, we also develop the measure of labor market slack for Mexico—the vacancy-to-unemployment (V/U) ratio for a longer period and at the regional level —which we use to analyze the relationship between labor market conditions and inflation. Furthermore, by incorporating vacancy data into a Structural Bayesian VAR, we identify key structural labor market shocks and explore their role in business cycle dynamics. Our results indicate that the Beveridge Curve fluctuations are largely driven by labor market shocks: unemployment dynamics reflect labor supply and matching efficiency shocks, while wage bargaining shocks explain most of the variation in vacancies at the national level, with marked heterogeneity across regions.\nIn the future, I plan to deepen my research on the dynamics of unemployment. Specifically, I aim to examine how time variation in labor market matching efficiency influences inflation dynamics within a New Keynesian DSGE framework. Extending my work on unemployment dynamics, I plan to provide a structural framework to decompose the variation in unemployment, incorporating lag distribution. Building on this line of inquiry, I also intend to extend my work on forecasting unemployment rates—both at the aggregate and industry levels—by utilizing transition probabilities, as recent studies suggest that incorporating flow-based measures enhances the accuracy of unemployment forecasts. Furthermore, I plan to expand my joint work on Mexico’s Beveridge Curve by constructing counterfactual unemployment paths to quantify the extent and sources of observed shifts. Lastly, I am also interested in exploring the potential economic benefits for African countries that are members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, particularly in terms of economic growth and stability."

    "text": "Working Papers\nEstimating time-variation in matching efficiency and match elasticity for the US labor market (Job market paper)\nConference presentations: 2025 SEA (upcoming), 2025 SNDE, 2024 SEA, NTxEC 2024, 2024 MEG, 2024 WEAI\nThe paper estimates time-varying matching efficiency and match elasticity within a Cobb-Douglas matching function for the U.S. non-farm sector, using a state-space model. It evaluates two specifications: (i) no constant returns to scale (CRS) with time variation (my baseline model) and (ii) CRS with time variation. I compare these two models with the standard model without time variability, and the results show significant time variation in both parameters, even under stochastic volatility. Counterfactual vacancy estimates reveal that the non-CRS baseline model fits the data best. This model suggests a gradual decline in matching efficiency, indicating growing labor market inefficiencies. Matching efficiency and match elasticity with respect to unemployment are found to be procyclical. The procyclicality in efficiency can be attributed to reduced sectoral reallocation, as seen in CPS data, driven by structural economic shifts. Procyclical match elasticity points to the nonlinear effect of labor market tightness on the job-finding rate. The paper also finds a rise in the efficient unemployment rate after COVID-19, as estimated by the baseline model.\nEstimated Output Gap in a Wage-Inflation Expectations Model (with Azharul Islam, Irina Panovska, Srikanth Ramamurthy)\nWe study how incorporating adaptive learning-based inflation expectations for price and wage inflation can improve the performance of Unobserved Components (UC) models both when it comes to inference about the output gap and when it comes to forecasting performance. We use a quasi-structural model where the statistical UC decomposition is augmented with an inflation and a wage Phillips curve, and both the output gap and price and wage inflation expectations are estimated endogenously. To endogenize the expectations process, we incorporate learning-based expectations and bivariate feedback in the learning dynamics for wage and price inflation. Our model directly integrates the expectations dynamics of the Hybrid New Keynesian Philips Curve while also retaining the appealing statistical features of the UC framework, allowing us to extract information about the output gap. Several interesting sets of results stand out. First, we find conclusive evidence of bivariate feedback in the dynamics of price and wage inflation expectations. Second, while the perceived persistence of inflation fell during the early stages of the COVID pandemic, it increased sharply and substantially during the period 2021Q2-2022Q. Third, the estimated output gap started decreasing in mid-2019 prior to the pandemic, decreased sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, and bounced back rapidly. When compared to models that do not include information about wages and to models that do not endogenize inflation, our approach tracks recession dates quite closely. Finally, including information about the output gap and about the price and wage inflation expectations process helps improve macroeconomic forecasts for GDP growth, wage, and price inflation.\n\n\nUnderstanding unemployment dynamics\nConference presentation: NTxEC 2025 (upcoming)\nIn this paper, I revisit unemployment dynamics over the period 2003–2024, both in aggregate and across industries, using micro-level CPS data from IPUMS. Transitions from non-participation to both employment and unemployment play an important role. During the Great Recession, the increase in unemployment reflected both stronger inflows into unemployment (from employment and the labor force) and weaker outflows into employment. In contrast, during COVID-19, the sharp increase in unemployment was driven almost entirely by higher inflows from employment into unemployment. The relative importance of different flows for the cyclicality of unemployment also shifted over time. Between 2006 and 2012, job separations and job-finding rates had effects of comparable magnitude. However, in the subsequent period countercyclical separations became the dominant driver of cyclical fluctuations in unemployment, while the role of job finding diminished. Finally, the variation in the transitions from nonparticipation to unemployment accounted for 15–20% of the cyclical variation in the unemployment rate between 2013 and 2024. At an industry level, not all industries are at steady state, and the paper looks at out-of-steady state dynamics to decompose the variations in unemployment rate to the labor market flows.\n\n\nMexico’s Labor Market through the Lens of the Beveridge Curve (with Luis Fernando Colunga-Ramos, Irina Panovska, Miroslava Quiroga-Trevino, B. Elam Rodríguez-Alcaraz)\nThis paper presents the first Beveridge Curves for Mexico and its regions, constructed from a newly compiled dataset on job vacancies. Focusing on the post-COVID-19 period, the evidence reveals a sharp rise in labor market slack at the onset of the pandemic, followed by a gradual tightening from 2021 onward, with northern regions experiencing a faster recovery. By 2023, vacancy rates had declined without a corresponding increase in unemployment, suggesting a rebalancing of labor demand across regions. Building on the vacancy–unemployment relationship that defines the Beveridge Curve, the paper also develops the first measure of labor market slack for Mexico: the vacancy to unemployment (V/U) ratio, which is then used to analyze the relationship between labor market conditions and inflation. In addition, incorporating vacancy data into a Structural Bayesian VAR allows for the identification of structural labor market shocks and the examination of business cycle dynamics.The results indicate that Beveridge Curve variables are primarily driven by labor market shocks: unemployment dynamics are explained mainly by labor supply and matching efficiency shocks, while wage bargaining shocks account for most of the variation in vacancies at the national level, with notable heterogeneity across regions."

    "text": "My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that learning is not simply the accumulation of knowledge, but the development of the ability to apply, retain, and reproduce ideas in meaningful and lasting ways. I view learning as an active, iterative process—one that requires continuous self-evaluation, critical thinking, and the capacity to connect abstract concepts to real-world issues.\nI view teaching as a collaborative intellectual endeavor between instructor and students. For students, the central challenge is to think critically about what they learn and to grasp its broader significance. For instructors, the task is to present complex material in a way that is both clear and intellectually rigorous, while fostering a classroom environment that supports curiosity, confidence, and ongoing engagement. Incorporating student feedback is essential, making the teaching process dynamic and often reflective, requiring continual adaptation and introspection. This understanding came because of getting a range of experience form teaching undergraduate classes (both small and large class size), the graduate level bootcamp for incoming masters and Ph.D. cohort and being a teaching assistant for a range of classes including forecasting and quantitative focused classes.\nIn my classroom, I aim to simplify technical content through real-world examples, discussion-based learning, and intuitive explanations. I intentionally maintain a medium pace in lectures, recognizing that students learn at different speeds. I frequently use the whiteboard alongside slides—not only to slow the lecture tempo, but also to keep students focused and engaged. This approach allows me to observe students’ reactions, and when I sense a dip in attention, I introduce an active learning question or real-world example to bring them back into the discussion.\nI begin each class by revisiting key points from the previous session—particularly when the material is cumulative. This helps students orient themselves, even if they haven’t reviewed the last lecture, and ensures a smoother transition into new content. Before introducing a topic, I also contextualize its importance. For instance, when teaching GDP and national accounting, I might open with the question: “What does it mean for a country to be economically well-off?” This framing helps students understand the relevance of what they are about to learn.\nI stay current with economic developments through research, policy discussions, and academic conferences. Bringing this knowledge into the classroom allows me to highlight real-time applications of economic theory. I’ve found that students often respond enthusiastically—asking questions about methodology, data sources, and research careers. One student approached me to ask how to pursue a career in research and what skills were needed, which I found particularly rewarding.\nTo provide consistent feedback and keep students engaged, I introduced short in-class quizzes at the end of each chapter. To encourage discussion among students, I usually ask them to discuss with their peers and then mark their answers so that they do not attempt these quizzes individually and are able to get others’ opinion before selecting their answers. These quizzes are followed by open discussion, allowing students to reflect on their responses and learn from their mistakes. Although they are self-graded to reduce pressure, I ask how many students answered at least three out of five questions correctly. This informal poll encourages self-assessment and helps me gauge overall comprehension, allowing me to adjust the pace and revisit key concepts when needed. This approach has helped increase both engagement and attendance.\nI also emphasize practical skills by incorporating hands-on data exercises. When teaching macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and exchange rates, I guide students through how these statistics are constructed and how to access them using real-world data. This reinforces the connection between theory and policy and empowers students to pursue independent analysis.\nSome of the most rewarding teaching moments occur when students begin to think independently, ask insightful questions, or relate concepts to broader economic issues. These instances often spark peer-to-peer dialogue and lead to stronger retention of material. Ultimately, I believe that effective teaching is not simply about transferring knowledge—it is about instilling intellectual habits that will serve students long after they leave the classroom.\nTo support exam preparation, I provide students with practice questions approximately ten days in advance. This strategy encourages early engagement with the material and offers bonus credit for those who complete the questions prior to the review session. During the review, we discuss the solutions in depth, focusing on common pitfalls and reinforcing key concepts. I deliberately choose not to post the answers online, which increases attendance and ensures students come prepared to participate. These sessions are most effective when students have made an effort to engage beforehand, transforming the review into an interactive learning experience rather than a passive lecture. Additionally, this provides a valuable opportunity to support students who may be struggling by offering them a chance ask questions and improve their performance before the exam.\nIn addition to my undergraduate teaching, I served as an instructor for the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences Math Boot Camp, which I co-designed and co-taught with a colleague. I was fortunate enough to be selected among other students for teaching in the EPPS Boot Camp. The program was developed for incoming Ph.D. and Master’s students in EPPS—many of whom had limited exposure to advanced mathematics. Our goal was to reinforce essential mathematical tools while bridging the gap between theory and empirical application.\nWe focused on helping students understand mathematical relationships in the context of data and modeling assumptions. For instance, we demonstrated how matrix algebra forms the foundation of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, and discussed how different probability distributions are selected based on data properties. To deepen their engagement, we assigned research papers in advance and used them as the basis for class discussions—encouraging students to evaluate the assumptions and practical relevance of each method.\nI was also part of the virtual exchange program for Contemporary Macroeconomic Policy as teaching assistant. The virtual collaboration was between students from UTD and University of Marburg, Germany. We created a comprehensive agenda outlining key dates, expectations, grading criteria, and resource links to support students throughout the collaboration. Teams were thoughtfully formed to foster cohesion, and a WhatsApp group—established with consent—enabled informal communication without instructor interference. We encouraged participation through suggested ice-breakers and used Padlet to facilitate easy video sharing. Ongoing coordination between faculty and teaching assistants on both sides ensured the collaboration ran smoothly. This experience underscored how intentional design and responsiveness can create an inclusive, dynamic learning environment incorporating different geographies. In the business and economic forecasting class, where I served as a teaching assistant, students developed research projects that applied various quantitative and forecasting techniques and evaluated the performance of their models.\nIn all of my teaching, I aim to inspire curiosity, build confidence, and equip students with both the theoretical grounding and practical tools they need to succeed. I am happy to teach any courses as needed, however, based on my research and teaching experience, I am particularly well equipped to teach principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics, intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, international trade, business statistics, econometrics and mathematics. I aim to integrate research and data analytics into my courses, and mentor students by engaging with them in my research projects, and embrace opportunities to learn alongside them."

I am Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), expecting to graduate in December 2025. My primary research area is empirical macroeconomics and time series analysis, with secondary focus on Bayesian econometrics and econometrics. My dissertation focuses on understanding the driving forces behind cyclical behavior of unemployment and labor market efficiency in the U.S. economy and how incorporation of unemployment rate improves the output gap estimates. My research combines rich micro-level CPS data with modern state-space methodologies to answer these questions.\nIn my previous research experience as Research Fellow at Centre for WTO studies, India, I worked on evaluating the degree of market access provided across members countries under Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). This required analyzing large data sets from individual tariff schedules of several countries and sectors. I believe this background, combined with my current research on U.S. labor markets, positions me well to contribute to a department that values rigorous empirical research spanning both labor and international economics.\n\n,"
