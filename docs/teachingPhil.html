<div class="justify">
<p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that learning is not simply the accumulation of knowledge, but the development of the ability to apply, retain, and reproduce ideas in meaningful and lasting ways. I view learning as an active, iterative process—one that requires continuous self-evaluation, critical thinking, and the capacity to connect abstract concepts to real-world issues.</p>
<p>I view teaching as a collaborative intellectual endeavor between instructor and students. For students, the central challenge is to think critically about what they learn and to grasp its broader significance. For instructors, the task is to present complex material in a way that is both clear and intellectually rigorous, while fostering a classroom environment that supports curiosity, confidence, and ongoing engagement. Incorporating student feedback is essential, making the teaching process dynamic and often reflective, requiring continual adaptation and introspection. This understanding came because of getting a range of experience form teaching undergraduate classes (both small and large class size), the graduate level bootcamp for incoming masters and Ph.D.&nbsp;cohort and being a teaching assistant for a range of classes including forecasting and quantitative focused classes.</p>
<p>In my classroom, I aim to simplify technical content through real-world examples, discussion-based learning, and intuitive explanations. I intentionally maintain a medium pace in lectures, recognizing that students learn at different speeds. I frequently use the whiteboard alongside slides—not only to slow the lecture tempo, but also to keep students focused and engaged. This approach allows me to observe students’ reactions, and when I sense a dip in attention, I introduce an active learning question or real-world example to bring them back into the discussion.</p>
<p>I begin each class by revisiting key points from the previous session—particularly when the material is cumulative. This helps students orient themselves, even if they haven’t reviewed the last lecture, and ensures a smoother transition into new content. Before introducing a topic, I also contextualize its importance. For instance, when teaching GDP and national accounting, I might open with the question: “What does it mean for a country to be economically well-off?” This framing helps students understand the relevance of what they are about to learn.</p>
<p>I stay current with economic developments through research, policy discussions, and academic conferences. Bringing this knowledge into the classroom allows me to highlight real-time applications of economic theory. I’ve found that students often respond enthusiastically—asking questions about methodology, data sources, and research careers. One student approached me to ask how to pursue a career in research and what skills were needed, which I found particularly rewarding.</p>
<p>To provide consistent feedback and keep students engaged, I introduced short in-class quizzes at the end of each chapter. To encourage discussion among students, I usually ask them to discuss with their peers and then mark their answers so that they do not attempt these quizzes individually and are able to get others’ opinion before selecting their answers. These quizzes are followed by open discussion, allowing students to reflect on their responses and learn from their mistakes. Although they are self-graded to reduce pressure, I ask how many students answered at least three out of five questions correctly. This informal poll encourages self-assessment and helps me gauge overall comprehension, allowing me to adjust the pace and revisit key concepts when needed. This approach has helped increase both engagement and attendance.</p>
<p>I also emphasize practical skills by incorporating hands-on data exercises. When teaching macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and exchange rates, I guide students through how these statistics are constructed and how to access them using real-world data. This reinforces the connection between theory and policy and empowers students to pursue independent analysis.</p>
<p>Some of the most rewarding teaching moments occur when students begin to think independently, ask insightful questions, or relate concepts to broader economic issues. These instances often spark peer-to-peer dialogue and lead to stronger retention of material. Ultimately, I believe that effective teaching is not simply about transferring knowledge—it is about instilling intellectual habits that will serve students long after they leave the classroom.</p>
<p>To support exam preparation, I provide students with practice questions approximately ten days in advance. This strategy encourages early engagement with the material and offers bonus credit for those who complete the questions prior to the review session. During the review, we discuss the solutions in depth, focusing on common pitfalls and reinforcing key concepts. I deliberately choose not to post the answers online, which increases attendance and ensures students come prepared to participate. These sessions are most effective when students have made an effort to engage beforehand, transforming the review into an interactive learning experience rather than a passive lecture. Additionally, this provides a valuable opportunity to support students who may be struggling by offering them a chance ask questions and improve their performance before the exam.</p>
<p>In addition to my undergraduate teaching, I served as an instructor for the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences Math Boot Camp, which I co-designed and co-taught with a colleague. I was fortunate enough to be selected among other students for teaching in the EPPS Boot Camp. The program was developed for incoming Ph.D.&nbsp;and Master’s students in EPPS—many of whom had limited exposure to advanced mathematics. Our goal was to reinforce essential mathematical tools while bridging the gap between theory and empirical application.</p>
<p>We focused on helping students understand mathematical relationships in the context of data and modeling assumptions. For instance, we demonstrated how matrix algebra forms the foundation of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, and discussed how different probability distributions are selected based on data properties. To deepen their engagement, we assigned research papers in advance and used them as the basis for class discussions—encouraging students to evaluate the assumptions and practical relevance of each method.</p>
<p>I was also part of the virtual exchange program for Contemporary Macroeconomic Policy as teaching assistant. The virtual collaboration was between students from UTD and University of Marburg, Germany. We created a comprehensive agenda outlining key dates, expectations, grading criteria, and resource links to support students throughout the collaboration. Teams were thoughtfully formed to foster cohesion, and a WhatsApp group—established with consent—enabled informal communication without instructor interference. We encouraged participation through suggested ice-breakers and used Padlet to facilitate easy video sharing. Ongoing coordination between faculty and teaching assistants on both sides ensured the collaboration ran smoothly. This experience underscored how intentional design and responsiveness can create an inclusive, dynamic learning environment incorporating different geographies. In the business and economic forecasting class, where I served as a teaching assistant, students developed research projects that applied various quantitative and forecasting techniques and evaluated the performance of their models.</p>
<p>In all of my teaching, I aim to inspire curiosity, build confidence, and equip students with both the theoretical grounding and practical tools they need to succeed. I am happy to teach any courses as needed, however, based on my research and teaching experience, I am particularly well equipped to teach principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics, intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, international trade, business statistics, econometrics and mathematics.</p>
<p>If given the opportunity to work as an Assistant Professor of Economics at [<em>Institution</em>], I look forward to contributing to a collaborative learning environment with both faculty and students. I aim to integrate research and data analytics into my courses, and mentor students by engaging with them in my research projects, and embrace opportunities to learn alongside them. [<em>Last sentence is specific to the program/institution and addresses how I will contribute to the growth and development of the teaching population.</em>]</p>
